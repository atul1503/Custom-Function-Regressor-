# Custom-Function-Regressor
------------------------------

Custom Function Regressor using Stochastic Gradient in pure Python.

Usage:
-------
At the time of writing,you have to hard code your function.You also have to type the partial derivatives of the function with respect to all parameters.

Parameters are represented as w matrix where:

a=w[0]
b=w[1]
c=w[2]
d=w[3]
e=w[4]
.
.
.
etc.


You also have to give the no. of parameters in the coeff variable.

The function has to written to the pred variable.

dw matrix is the weight update matrix for each w index.
